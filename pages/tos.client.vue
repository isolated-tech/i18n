                Rights:</span
              >
              The i18n Software License facilitates the acquisition of i18n
              software through a single purchase, granting users unrestricted
              and perpetual access to its comprehensive functionalities.
              Tailored for independent creators, entrepreneurs, and small
              businesses, i18n empowers users to create compelling web pages and
              online portfolios. This license entails a straightforward and
              flexible arrangement, exempting users from recurring fees or
              subscriptions. However, it is important to acknowledge that the
              licensor retains the right to terminate the license without
              conditions or prerequisites. This termination provision enables
              the licensor to exercise control over software distribution and
              utilization. Opting for the i18n Software License enables users to
              enjoy the benefits of the software while recognizing the
              licensor's unrestricted termination rights, which provide
              adaptability and address potential unforeseen circumstances.
